### About Crisis Preparedness for Religious Organisations (CPRO)

The Crisis Preparedness for Religious Organisations (CPRO) programme aims to strengthen crisis preparedness of Religious Organisations by building capabilities to protect their premises and congregants, and help others in the community in times of crises.

The CPRO is an initiative under the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY)’s SGSecure Community Network (SGCN) to ensure that all ROs are well-prepared for crises. MCCY partnered representatives from Religious Organisations to develop the programme, and established partnerships with security and community partners.
