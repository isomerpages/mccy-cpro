### Frequently Asked Questions (Phase Two)

**1. My family members and I live in separate households. Can I pray with them at the place of worship?**
  * Yes. A group of up to 5 worshippers can pray together.
  * Groups of worshippers must be 1 metre apart, and there must be no mixing between groups.

**2. Can I pray with my friends at the place of worship? Must we have a distance of 1 metre between us?**
  * Yes. A group of up to 5 worshippers can pray together.
  * Groups of worshippers must be 1 metre apart, and there must be no mixing between groups. Individuals within a group do not need to be 1 metre apart from each other. 
  
**3. With the increase in limit for worship services, may a worshipper pray with family and friends in bigger groups?**
  * No. In line with the prevailing group size limits, only groups of up to 5 worshippers can pray together.
    * While the number of community cases has remained low with the continued vigilance of businesses and the public, the likelihood of a second wave remains.
    * We have seen this in other countries which had seen a surge in cases after a long period where case numbers were low. 
    * We need to continue to take a cautious approach and limit the number of potential contacts that a person infected with COVID-19 can spread the disease to. 
    * This is why we have restricted gatherings outside the home to no more than 5 people for now.  
  * Groups of worshippers must be 1 metre apart, and there must be no mixing between groups.

**4. Must I wear a mask at the place of worship, even while praying?**
  * Yes, everyone (except children below 6 years of age) entering places of worship must wear their masks at all times.
  * Children twelve years and below, as well as persons who have health conditions that may result in breathing or other medical difficulties when a mask is worn for a prolonged period of time, may wear a face shield in lieu of a face mask. Refer to Ministry of Health's [Guidance for Use of Masks and Face Shields](https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/guidance-for-use-of-masks-and-face-shields).
  * Young children are strongly encouraged to use a mask or face shield, especially if they are in a group setting (e.g. in worship service or religious class) or when interacting with others. 
  
**5. What is the safe capacity limit for a place of worship at any one time?**
  * From 3 October 2020: 
    * ROs can conduct congregational and other worship services for up to 100 persons, while adhering to the required SMMs (including zoning for congregational worship).
    * ROs may also concurrently conduct other permitted religious activities for up to a total of 100 persons on the premises, and only if these activities can be conducted safely at separate locations within the place of worship. 
    * Specific limits on certain activities (e.g. 30 persons for funerals and wakes, 50 persons for religious classes) continue to apply. 
    * There must be sufficient signs and directions to guide the different parties such that they do not interact or meet with parties from other zones while entering, exiting, or while in the premises. 
  * While the attendance limits for worship services and other religious activities has been raised, MCCY continues to urge ROs to minimise the number of physical gatherings and the number of people on-site. 

**6. Is the number of visitors to the columbaria in my temple included in my premise capacity limit?**
  *	Yes. From 3 Oct 2020, there can be a maximum of 100 persons in the premises taking part in various religious activities (excluding congregational and other worship services). This limit excludes the religious and essential workers. 

**7. Can I have multiple worship services (e.g. different language services) at the same time? How many persons are allowed at each service?**
  * Yes, multiple services are allowed if they can be conducted safely at separate locations within the place of worship, with adequate signs and directions to guide the different congregations such that they do not interact or meet each other while entering, exiting or while in the premises. 
  * ROs must work within the total cap of 100 persons (with effect 3 Oct 2020) for these worship services. 
    * For example: if there are two concurrent worship services, each can be allocated a limit of 50 persons.

**8. My premises are very large with multiple prayer halls. Can I have multiples of 100 persons for worship services?**
  * No. The limit of 100 persons for worship services (with effect 3 Oct 2020) applies to all places of worship, regardless of the premise size. This is to manage the risks of conducting worship services at a larger scale and to allow the places of worship to implement their safe management measures.
  * We hope to gradually raise the congregation limit beyond 100 persons, if COVID-19 community transmission remains low and stable, and places of worship are able to implement the safe management measures.  

**9. When will there be an increase in worship services from 100 to 200 persons?**
  * MCCY hopes to gradually raise the congregation limit beyond 100 persons, if COVID-19 community transmission remains low and stable, and places of worship are able to implement the safe management measures.   * With effect from 3 Oct 2020, the maximum number of worshippers allowed for worship services is 100.

**10. Can I have more than one group of 5 in a religious class, in the same room?**
  * Yes. Where necessary, there can be multiple groups of 5, so long as each group is separated by at least 1 metre with no mingling across groups. The total number of persons must not exceed 50 (including the religious worker / teacher  (and supporting workers, if any)
  * As a best practice, we encourage a greater separation of 2 metres between groups of students attending religious classes.
  * ROs must keep within the premise limit of 100 persons (with effect 3 Oct 2020) for religious classes and other permitted religious activities (excluding congregational and other worship services). 

**11. How many religious workers, staff and volunteers are we allowed to deploy on-site for worship services? Will this count towards the cap of 50 persons for worship services?**
  * Places of worship may deploy the required manpower to facilitate worship services and other permitted religious activities. The manpower must be limited to essential tasks, kept to a minimum number and adhere to safe management measures. 
  * The cap of 100 persons (with effect 3 Oct 2020) for worship services excludes the manpower deployed for this purpose.
  * Places of worship can refer to MCCY’s [volunteer management guide for best practices for managing volunteers](https://www.mccy.gov.sg/about-us/news-and-resources/press-statements/2020/jun/Guidelines-for-volunteer-management-during-covid19-pandemic-2).

**12. How do we regulate worshipper / devotee flow on-site?**
  * Religious organisations can consider various best practices such as only allowing worshippers to enter the place of worship by appointment or use a booking system for the worship service. 
  
**13. Can I conduct religious rites (e.g. baptism, communion, medium prayers, receive holy ash) that involve physical contact with worshippers?**
  * As this rite involves physical contact, it will be a deviation from the parameters in MCCY’s 18 June advisory on resumption of more religious activities in Phase Two. 
  * For such deviation cases, you have to first submit a safe management plan that explains how this religious rite can be conducted safely and then wait for MCCY’s approval before commencing the rite.  

**14. Can I open the ancestral hall at my temple to visitors?**
  * Yes. Similar to visitors to columbaria in places of worship, visitors to the ancestral hall should maintain a safe distancing of at least 1 metre between individuals at all times. 
  * Families who visit in groups are limited to no more than 5 persons in a group, with safe distancing of at least 1 metre between groups. These visits should be kept as short as possible, with no mingling between groups

**15. Can a religious worker make house visits to conduct prayers?**
  * House visits by religious workers are not encouraged. 
  * Religious workers who need to make a house visit should abide by the prevailing restrictions on homes, where visits are limited to 5 visitors at a time. 
  * The prayers should be kept to a minimum duration. The religious worker and those present in the home should comply with safe distancing and other safe management measures.

**16. Can I provide food to my devotees as part of worship services?**
  * No. Food should not be served to worshippers before, during or after each worship service. 
  * Services should be kept short as possible, with no mingling of worshippers. Worshippers should also leave the premises immediately after performing their worship. 
  
**17. Do ROs need to submit SMPs before proceeding with 100-persons worship services?**
  * ROs that wish to conduct 100-persons services will be required to submit an updated SMP with the additional SMMs at least three days before commencing.
  * This includes ROs that have previously submitted their Phase Two SMPs.
  * More information will be available on www.cpro.gov.sg. MCCY will also be conducting sector-wide briefings to ROs of various faith groups before the 100-person limit takes effect from 3 Oct 2020.
