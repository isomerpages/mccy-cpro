### FAST AND EASY TESTING FOR RELIGIOUS ORGANISATIONS

1.   Since late-June 2021, the Fast and East Testing (“FET”) regime has been progressively rolled out for all higher risk sectors. With effect from 25 October 2021, the FET will be rolled out for all Religious Organisations (RO) conducting in-person religious classes for children aged 12 and below. ROs must comply with the mandatory requirements set out in this updated notice. For avoidance of doubt, the mandatory requirements are specified in the paragraphs below prefaced with the words ‘[Mandatory]’.
 
2.   ROs are to also comply with the latest guidelines for resumption of religious activities issued on x October 2021 here [insert link].< link to latest advisory>
 
#### Background
 
3.   The purpose of the FET regime is to further reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19 in settings with unmasked clients, or where services are performed under prolonged and close contact with clients, or where there are frequent interactions with the community. Under the FET regime, ROs are required to ensure that their employees and persons who work under their direction (e.g. religious and supporting workers) undergo regular FET using the COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test (“ART”), regardless of their vaccination status. Volunteers working in these settings should also ensure that they adhere to the FET regime.
 
4.   The FET regime and the mandatory requirements set out in this notice are imposed on ROs under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020. Failure to comply with the requirements set out herein may result in prosecution and/or other enforcement action, including suspension/closure of operations (1). Checks will be conducted by enforcement teams to verify if ROs have complied with the mandatory requirements set out in this notice.

#### FET Requirements for Religious Organisations conducting in-person religious classes for children aged 12 and below
 
5.  [Mandatory] All ROs must ensure that their employees (2) and persons who work under their direction(3) (collectively, “Workers”) undergo FET once every 7 days (the “FET Requirement”). Please refer to the [FET workflow](/files/FETLogicFlowforROs.pdf).
 
6. For unvaccinated Workers, they are required to undergo VoRT (testing twice a week). The interval between their weekly tests must be at least 3 to 4 days.
 
7. For Workers taking part in Live Performance elements with singing or playing of wind/brass instruments, they are required to continue taking ART from MOH-approved clinics or Quick-Test Centres (QTCs).
 
8.  [Mandatory] After their Workers undergo FET, ROs shall verify (4)  Worker’s test results.
 
9.   Where the Worker has obtained an “AG+” test result, ROs are strongly recommended to guide the Worker to abide by the prevailing management postures for such cases that are set out on MOH’s website at https://www.moh.gov.sg/ or at the following [link](/files/AnnexA-FETTestResultsandtheManagementofWorkersafterESSS%20.pdf).
 
10.   To meet the FET Requirement, ROs are to conduct Employer-Supervised Self-Swab (“ESSS”) for their Workers. The costs for the ART test kits that will be used for ESSS and the training required for ROs that wish to conduct ESSS will be borne by the Government until 31 December 2021.
 
 
#### Rquirements for Religious Organisations conducting ESSS
 
11.  ESSS involves Workers using an ART kit and performing a swab on themselves under the supervision of a trained supervisor (“Supervisor”). The swabbing and supervision can be done either at the workplace or virtually using tools such as video conferencing.  
 
12. [Mandatory] To satisfy the FET Requirement, ROs conducting ESSS for their Workers shall:
appoint an adequate number of Supervisors to supervise every Worker whenever they carry out the swabs on themselves;
ensure that the Supervisor has satisfied the training requirements set out under paragraph 14 below and properly performs his supervisory role5;
