### FAST AND EASY TESTING FOR RELIGIOUS ORGANISATIONS

1) Since late-June 2021, the Fast and Easy Testing (“**FET**”) regime has been progressively rolled out for all higher risk sectors. With effect from **25 October 2021**, the FET will be rolled out for all Religious Organisations (RO) (1) **conducting in-person religious classes for children aged 12 and below**.  This applies to persons who are involved in the religious classes for more than once a month. ROs must comply with the mandatory requirements set out in this updated notice. For avoidance of doubt, the mandatory requirements are specified in the paragraphs below prefaced with the words ‘[Mandatory]’.
 
2) ROs are to also comply with the latest guidelines for resumption of religious activities issued on 25 January 2022 [here](/files/UpdatedSMMsforReligiousActivities.pdf).
 
#### Background
 
3) The purpose of the FET regime is to further reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19 in settings with unmasked clients, or where services are performed under prolonged and close contact with clients, or where there are frequent interactions with the community. Under the FET regime, ROs are required to ensure that their employees and persons who work under their direction (e.g. religious and supporting workers) undergo regular FET using the COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test (“**ART**”), regardless of their vaccination status. Volunteers working in these settings should also ensure that they adhere to the FET regime.
 
4) The FET regime and the mandatory requirements set out in this notice are imposed on ROs under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020. Failure to comply with the requirements set out herein may result in prosecution and/or other enforcement action, including suspension/closure of operations (2). Checks will be conducted by enforcement teams to verify if ROs have complied with the mandatory requirements set out in this notice.

#### FET Requirements for Religious Organisations conducting in-person religious classes for children aged 12 and below
 
5)  [Mandatory] All ROs must ensure that their employees (3) and persons who work under their direction(4) (collectively, “**Workers**”) undergo FET once every 7 days (the “FET Requirement”). Please refer to the [FET workflow](/files/2022_FET_Logic_Flow_for_ROs_edited_v3.pdf).
 
6) For **unvaccinated Workers**, they are required to undergo VoRT (testing twice a week). The interval between their weekly tests must be at least 3 to 4 days.
 
7) For Workers taking part in **Live Performance elements with singing or playing of wind/brass instruments**, they are required to continue taking ART from MOH-approved clinics or Quick-Test Centres (QTCs).
 
8) [Mandatory] After their Workers undergo FET, ROs shall verify (5)  Worker’s test results.
 
9) Where the Worker has obtained an “AG+” test result, ROs are strongly recommended to guide the Worker to abide by the prevailing management postures for such cases that are set out on MOH’s website at [https://www.moh.gov.sg/](https://www.moh.gov.sg) or at the following [link](/files/AnnexA-FETTestResultsandtheManagementofWorkersafterESSS%20.pdf).
 
10) To meet the FET Requirement, ROs are to conduct **Employer-Supervised Self-Swab (“ESSS”)** for their Workers. The costs for the ART test kits that will be used for ESSS will be borne by the Government until 31 March 2022.
 
#### Requirements for Religious Organisations conducting ESSS
 
11) ESSS involves Workers using an ART kit and performing a swab on themselves under the supervision of a supervisor (“**Supervisor**”). The swabbing and supervision can be done either at the workplace or virtually using tools such as video conferencing.

12) [Mandatory] To satisfy the FET Requirement, ROs conducting ESSS for their Workers shall:
* i. Appoint an adequate number of Supervisors to supervise every Worker whenever they carry out the swabs on themselves;
ensure that the Supervisor properly performs his supervisory role (6);
* ii. ensure that Workers comply with the steps set out in paragraph 14 and properly perform the swabs on themselves;
* iii. ensure that the test results obtained by Workers from ESSS are uploaded on the Swab Registration System (“**SRS**”) in accordance with the requirements set out under paragraph 15 below; and
* iv. ensure that the ART test kits used for ESSS are those that are set out on the Health Sciences Authority’s website at [https://www.hsa.gov.sg/consumer-safety/articles/covid19_ARTselftests](https://www.hsa.gov.sg/consumer-safety/articles/covid19_ARTselftests ) 

13)  Where the Workers have obtained an “AG+” test result while conducting ESSS, ROs are recommended to strongly encourage them to undertake a follow-up ART test and to abide by the prevailing management postures for such cases that are set out on MOH’s website at [https://www.moh.gov.sg/](https://www.moh.gov.sg/). The follow-up ART test does not need to be carried out under supervision and the results do not need to be uploaded to SRS. ROs are to use self-sourced ART test kits for the follow-up ART test and not those that have been supplied by the Government under the FET regime.
 
#### Conduct of ESSS by Workers

14)  [Mandatory] ROs are required to ensure that their Workers shall:
* be supervised (7) by a Supervisor whenever they carry out ESSS;
* use new ART test kits whenever they carry out ESSS; and
* properly dispose of used ART test kits after they have carried out ESSS (8).
 
#### Uploading of Test Results onto SRS
 
15)  [Mandatory] ROs are required to upload the test results obtained by their Workers from ESSS onto SRS in accordance with the following:
* if the test result is “AG+”, ROs are to upload the test result of that Worker onto SRS **no later than 12 hours** after the ESSS for that specific Worker is completed;
* if the test result is “AG-”, ROs are to upload the test result of that Worker **no later than 24 hours** after the ESSS for that specific Worker is completed; and
* the requirements set out under paragraphs 4 and 6 of Annex A.
 
16)  More details on the registration for an SRS account can be found [here](/files/SRSguide.pdf).  
 
#### Support for ROs conducting ESSS
 
17)  The Government will be supplying ART test kits to ROs until 31 March 2022. To place an order for the ART test kits, ROs are required to submit the relevant information using this [form](https://go.gov.sg/fetvortros). ROs that operate across multiple premises (e.g. branches and locations) should submit a separate “Order form” for each premises.(9) The ART test kits will be delivered to ROs on first-come-first-served basis. **ROs shall only use the ART test kits that are supplied by the Government for ESSS and shall not distribute, supply or sell them to any third-party.** ART Test Kits must be used with prudence and companies need to ensure that one employee only use one test kit for one cycle of RRT, unless the test result is AG invalid. 
 
18)  After submission of the “Order form”, a confirmation email and SMS from a third-party vendor will be sent to your POC with the delivery date within a week.
 
19)  The information that is submitted on the “Order Form” will also be used by the relevant Government agencies to help ROs set up an SRS account. Once the SRS account has been set up, your POC will receive an email notification informing them about the creation of the SRS account and how to upload test results onto it.

#### Support from Religious Organisations
 
20)  The fight against COVID-19 requires the collective effort of everyone in the community. We seek the support and understanding of all ROs during this period. We will continue to review and adjust the measures in line with the national posture for the health and well-being of the public and employees.
 
21)  For SRS related enquiries, you may also email SRS Support Email at AskSRS@hpb.gov.sg or the SRS Support hotline at 6876 5848, from Monday to Friday: 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Saturday: 8.a.m. to 1 p.m. The hotline is closed on Sundays and Public Holidays.

##### Footnotes

(1) [Updated as of 1 November 2021] Individuals who have recovered from a COVID-19 infection in the past 270 days are exempted from the FET Requirement. If the infection was more than 270 days ago, they can be exempted from the FET Requirement only if they are fully vaccinated. This includes persons who a) recovered from a COVID-19 infection and subsequently receives at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine (two doses if Sinovac or Sinopharm) that has been authorised under the Health Sciences Authority’s Pandemic Special Access Route or listed on the World Health Organisation’s Emergency Use Listing (WHO EUL) no earlier than 3 months after date of positive PCR, and b) are fully vaccinated before being infected with COVID-19 and subsequently recovering from it. Persons who received one dose of COVID-19 vaccine before being infected would need to receive their 2nd dose (3rd dose if Sinovac or Sinopharm) to be exempted. For individuals who are re-infected, the 270 days exemption starts from the date of the first C+ result of the re-infection.

(2) ROs are reminded to comply with the other requirements imposed under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020 and implement the [Safe Management Measures (“**SMMs**”)](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-for-safe-management-measures) as set out on the [COVID Gobusiness website](https://www.gobusiness.gov.sg/covid/). They are also reminded to comply with the relevant [SMMs](https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/covid-19/safe-distance/#FB) that have been set out by Enterprise Singapore (ESG), Housing & Development Board (HDB), Singapore Food Agency (SFA), Sport Singapore (SportSG), National Environment Agency (NEA), Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), Singapore Tourism Board (STB) and Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA).

(3) This includes both full and part time employees, such as full-time office assistants, religious workers, regular volunteers and staff working with children.

(4) This includes contractors (e.g. cleaners), subcontractors, employees of contractors and subcontractors who work at the workplace. This also includes business owners and store managers that work at the workplace.

(5) ROs are required to inspect any physical test result slip, SMS or test kit evidencing the test result of the Worker. It would not be sufficient for ROs to rely on oral statements by Workers to fulfill this obligation.

(6) This includes wearing adequate personal protective equipment and maintaining appropriate infection prevention control procedures while conducting supervision.

(7) ROs can consider asking Supervisors to verify their vaccination status via TraceTogether. This can be done in person or virtually.

(8) Used test kits should be double-bagged and tied before disposing them in closed bins (e.g. pedal bins).

(9) For ROs with multiple outlets under the same UEN, you may submit your request to create multiple SRS company accounts under the same UEN. However, there must be a unique mobile number and email address used for each account. ROs without a UEN can indicate their NRIC in the UEN field instead.
