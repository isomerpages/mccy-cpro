### FAST AND EASY TESTING FOR RELIGIOUS ORGANISATIONS

1.   Since late-June 2021, the Fast and East Testing (“FET”) regime has been progressively rolled out for all higher risk sectors. With effect from 25 October 2021, the FET will be rolled out for all Religious Organisations (RO) conducting in-person religious classes for children aged 12 and below. ROs must comply with the mandatory requirements set out in this updated notice. For avoidance of doubt, the mandatory requirements are specified in the paragraphs below prefaced with the words ‘[Mandatory]’.
 
2.   ROs are to also comply with the latest guidelines for resumption of religious activities issued on x October 2021 here [insert link].< link to latest advisory>
 
#### Background
 
3.   The purpose of the FET regime is to further reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19 in settings with unmasked clients, or where services are performed under prolonged and close contact with clients, or where there are frequent interactions with the community. Under the FET regime, ROs are required to ensure that their employees and persons who work under their direction (e.g. religious and supporting workers) undergo regular FET using the COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test (“ART”), regardless of their vaccination status. Volunteers working in these settings should also ensure that they adhere to the FET regime.
 
4.   The FET regime and the mandatory requirements set out in this notice are imposed on ROs under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020. Failure to comply with the requirements set out herein may result in prosecution and/or other enforcement action, including suspension/closure of operations (1). Checks will be conducted by enforcement teams to verify if ROs have complied with the mandatory requirements set out in this notice.
