**Fast and Easy Testing (FET) and VoRT Regime for Religious Organisations (ROs)**

**A. General Queries on FET**

Q1.	Who will have to undergo the mandatory Fast & Easy Testing (FET)?  

From 25 October 2021, FET would be mandatory for all religious and supporting workers conducting in-person religious classes for children aged 12 and below. 

This includes full and part-time employees such as full-time office assistants, religious workers, volunteers, and cleaners.

Q2.	How often will I need to be tested under the FET? 

From 25 October 2021 onwards, workers on the mandatory FET regime must do their testing once a week (every 7 days), regardless of vaccination status.


Q3.	If I am fully vaccinated, do I still need to undergo the FET?

All workers in the fields highlighted in Q1, regardless of vaccination status, will need to undergo the mandatory FET testing.

4.	If one is medically ineligible to be vaccinated, what is the testing regime to adhere to?

All workers in higher-risk settings (see Q1) will need to undergo testing twice a week under the Vaccinate or Regular Test (VoRT) regime if they are unvaccinated (inclusive of one test per week for FET). This is regardless of their medical eligibility for vaccination.


5.	If I am medically eligible but yet to be fully vaccinated, what is the testing regime to adhere to?

All workers in higher-risk settings (see Q1) will need to undergo testing twice a week under the Vaccinate or Regular Test (VoRT) regime if they are unvaccinated (inclusive of one test per week for FET). This is regardless of their medical eligibility for vaccination.

If your vaccination status changes to “Fully Vaccinated” after 25 October, and you can stop undergoing VoRT, please write in to CPRO@mccy.gov.sg to deregister yourself from the VoRT database.

6.	What happens if the FET mandatory testing is not adhered to?  

Please note that this FET regime is being imposed under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations. Failure to comply with the requirements set out herein may result in prosecution and/or other enforcement action, including suspension/closure of operations(1).

7.	Is FET mandatory for workers who are not involved in conducting religious classes for children 12 years and below?

No, the FET is mandatory only for workers who conduct classes with students/ participants/ individuals in the relevant fields outlined in Q1. It is not mandatory for workers conducting congregational worship services regardless of whether they are full-time, part-time, or contracted instructors/employees.


8.	How will the FET be conducted?  

FET can be conducted for workers through Employer-Supervised Self-Swab (ESSS). Antigen Rapid Test (ART) kits will be provided, and instructors and staff will swab themselves under the supervision of a trained staff (‘supervisor’). The supervision can be done either onsite at the workplace or virtually using tools such as video conferencing. 

ART conducted at Quick Test Centres (QTCs) and MOH-approved clinics are permissible replacements, although the costs at QTCs and clinics will be borne by the individual or RO. Workers that decide to do their ART at QTCs or MOH-approved clinics will still require their results to be recorded in the SRS.


9.	What type of test will I have to take during the FET?

You will have to take the Antigen Rapid Test (ART). 



**B. General Queries on VoRT**

10.	What is the Vaccinate or Regular Testing (VoRT) regime?  

The VoRT is a regular testing regime for individuals who are not fully vaccinated and are conducting in-person religious classes for children 12 years and below.

Businesses should guide their Workers(2)  who are not fully vaccinated to be tested two times a week (e.g. Days 3 and 7 of the week or Days 1 and 4 of the week). 

The VoRT regime will apply concurrently with the FET Rostered Routine Testing regime that these persons are currently subject to and is effective from 25 October 2021 onwards. 


11.	When am I considered ‘fully vaccinated’?

(a)	Vaccinated with no prior history of COVID-19 infection – starting 14 days after the day of vaccination and ending 365 days later.

(b)	Recovered from COVID-19 infection without prior vaccination – starting the day of testing positive for SARS-SoV-2 via a PCR test and ending 270 days later.

(c)	Recovered from COVID-19 infection and subsequently vaccinated - starting 14 days after the day of vaccination and ending 365 days later.

12.	Am I considered fully vaccinated if I have recovered from Covid-19?

Yes, you will be considered fully vaccinated for 270 days since the first positive test. 

**C. ESSS For ROs**

13.	Who bears the cost of the Antigen Rapid Test (ART) kits? 

The costs for the Antigen Rapid Test (ART) kits and supervisor training for all eligible will be borne by the Government until 31 Dec 2021.  


14.	Is it mandatory for staff to be trained supervisors for the Employer-Supervised Self-Swabs (ESSS)? 

From 1 Nov 2021, The 4-hour HMI training is no longer a mandatory requirement to perform the role of a supervisor for employer supervised self swab (ESSS). For ROs who want to continue sending employees for the course it will still be made available but will not be funded.

To register staff for the Supervisory Training, ROs can book their training slot directly with HMI Institute at https://hmi-ihs.com/supervisory-training-in-art-self-swab/.


15.	How can ROs register for self-collection of kits for ESSS and the Swab Registration System (SRS)?

To facilitate the collection of test kits, setup of SRS accounts, and notification of arts instruction activities, ROs should submit full details on https://go.gov.sg/fetvortros.

•	ROs with multiple outlets are encouraged to submit a form for each outlet, however all outlets should indicate the same collection address (see the form for more details).

•	The point of contact (POC) indicated in the form must be the supervisor or employee who will be responsible for both self-collection of the test kits, and the Supervisor’s uploading of FET results to the SRS account. 

•	ROs have the flexibility to decide who is the POC and Supervisor for ESSS. One employee may serve as both the POC and Supervisor, or different employees may be appointed for the two roles.

•	The kits, funded by the Government, will be provided monthly (till 31 Dec 2021). 


16.	How can ROs record the test results on the Swab Registration System (SRS)?

ROs are to upload the ART results of their employees into SRS. CPRO will assist to create SRS accounts for your company using the same information provided in the form (see Q15). The POCs nominated will receive an email notification after the accounts have been set up. Please check your junk mail folder if the POCs do not receive the email. 
 
Supervisors are required to upload the results of the employees’ swab tests to the SRS https://swab.hpb.gov.sg/ext/index.aspx. 

•	If the test result is “AG+” or “Double Invalid”, Businesses are to upload the test result of that instructor/employee onto SRS no later than 30 minutes after the ESSS for that specific instructor/employee is completed. From 1 Nov, we will adjust the requirement to submit Ag+ results within 30 minutes to within 12 hours.

•	If the test result is “AG-”, Businesses are to upload the test result of that Worker no later than 24 hours after the ESSS for that specific instructor/employee is completed. 

Please refer to https://cpro.gov.sg/files/SRSguide.pdf for more information on SRS account.

17.	What if my RO operates across various venues/studios?

ROs with multiple venues are encouraged to submit a form for each venue, however all outlets should indicate the same collection address (see the form in Q15 for more details).


18.	My RO has several locations, am I able to be the supervisor for all the branches? 

No. You are required to appoint different supervisors for each of the locations. However, all outlets should indicate the same collection address (see Q17). Kindly note that only 1 supervisor is only allowed to be assigned under one UEN. 


19.	What do I do if my Swab Registration System (SRS) account gets blocked?

Please email CPRO at CPRO@mccy.gov.sg for assistance.


20.	If my cleaner comes in on an ad hoc basis (e.g. once in 2 weeks) and may be a different cleaner each time from the cleaning company, how do I go about doing the FET every 7 days?

Please check with the cleaning company regarding the FET status of the cleaners that they deploy to your premises. If the cleaner needs to be tested, your RO will have to ensure that the cleaner has a valid ART result (taken within the past 7 days) before they report at your premises for their cleaning duties. This may be verified through their HealthHub app.


21.	The workers in my RO are all part-timers and are often on rotation and some not teaching for periods of time.  Do they need to do testing if they are not in current rotation, or aren't teaching for the time being? 

Yes, all workers, including part-timers, must undergo FET training regularly even if they do not come into contact with children 12 years and below often.


22.	Some of our workers are volunteers and they serve several other companies apart from our RO. Do we include their test results similarly with our other employees?

If your volunteers undergo FET weekly for their other jobs and will be involved in conducting classes for children 12 years and below, you need to report their test results as well. As an RO, you will need to ensure that the volunteer has a valid ART result (taken within the past 7 days). This may be checked through their HealthHub app.


23.	What should I do if a worker obtains a positive ART result (AG+) or two invalid ART results? 

You must send asymptomatic AG+ or double Invalid result cases to a Swab and Send Home Public Health Preparedness Clinic (SASH PHPC) for a Government-funded confirmatory Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test. You must issue a signed referral note and arrange for private transport to the SASH PHPC for such cases. Please remind the worker to present his or her NRIC and the referral note at the clinic for verification. 
 
After the PCR test is conducted, the worker must self-isolate at home until the PCR results return. If the PCR result returns negative, they can return to work. However, if the PCR result returns positive, Public Health Actions (e.g. conveyance to the hospital, contact tracing etc.) will commence. 

**D. Other General FET/VoRT Queries**

24. Am I still allowed to continue conducting classes if I missed my weekly testing?

Under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations, the FET regime is mandatory for all workers involved in conducting religious classes for children 12 years old and below. The FET regime should be conducted at least once every 7 days (if fully vaccinated) for workers to continue conducting classes. Failure to comply may result in prosecution and/or other enforcement actions, including suspension of operation. Checks will be conducted by enforcement teams to verify compliance.	 


25.	If I am not conducting classes this month, do I need to undergo FET?

You are encouraged to remain on the FET regime even if you are not conducting classes temporarily and continue with weekly testing. This will allow you to be ready to conduct classes when able to resume.  


26.	If I am discontinuing all my in-person classes and only conducting online classes, do I still have to undergo FET?

Please note that if your physical classes are suspended for the foreseeable future, and you will not be conducting any class in person, then you should de-register yourself by emailing CPRO at CPRO@mccy.gov.sg. Otherwise, you will be expected to conduct regular testing every 7 days.


27.	If I am teaching at different ROs/other venues, will I need to take a separate test with each of them?

No. You are only required to take the test once every 7 days under FET. Your details and test result are available via SMS and they will be recorded in the HealthHub SG app and can be used as proof that you have done your test.


28.	I am currently a staff at other workplaces that already require me to get tested every week. Can I be exempted from FET for ROs?

If you are already tested regularly under FET, you do not have to take another separate test for ROs. The ROs are still required to register you for FET results on their SRS account.


29.	What if I am ill on the day of my test? Can I still take the ART?

Please note that workers should not take the Antigen Rapid Test if they have: 

•	Acute respiratory symptoms (e.g. fever, cough, flu or running nose). Instead, please visit your doctor for treatment immediately. 

•	A nosebleed in the past 24 hours

•	Done a nasal surgery in the last 4 weeks 

•	Facial injury in the last 8 weeks 

Please submit a new request on the same registration link as soon as you recover and are able to take the test.


30.	Can FET be applied for workers who wish to be involved in the live performance for worship services with singing and playing of wind/brass instruments?

No. Currently, FET is only required for workers who are involved in conducting religious classes with children aged 12 years and under. Workers involved in live performances with singing and/or playing of wind/brass instruments must still take ART from MOH-approved clinics or Quick Test Centres (QTCs).


31.	May I use ART kits that are not provided by the Government?

Yes, as long as the ART test kits used are those that are set out on the Health Sciences Authority’s website: https://www.hsa.gov.sg/consumer-safety/articles/covid19_ARTselftests 


32.	If I have a religious rite (eg. Baptism) that involves children aged 12 years and below, are the workers required to undergo FET?

Currently, religious rites that involve children are not required to have the workers undergo FET. However, we highly encourage workers to self-test ART weekly or before their duties.
