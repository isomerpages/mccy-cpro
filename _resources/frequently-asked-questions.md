**General Safe Management Measures**
1. What is the capacity limit for a place of worship at any one time?

From 29 March 2022

Worship services and other mask-on religious activities can be held for up to involving 1,000 worshippers at a time. If there are more than 1,000 worshippers, it should be capped at 75% premises’ capacity taking into account the occupant load requirement under fire safety rules. Worshippers must, as far as is reasonably practicable, be evenly spread out when present in the event venue.

2. How is the 75% capacity for >1,000 worshippers calculated? 

75% capacity takes reference from the prevailing maximum occupancy load (m2/person) of the venue, per the fire safety code or fixed seating. The 75% limit will then be applied to this maximum occupancy load. Full fire safety code can be accessed here: https://www.scdf.gov.sg/docs/default-source/scdf-library/fssd-downloads/chapter-1.pdf
