### Preparing for our Transition out of Phase Two (Heightened Alert) Updated Measures for Religious Activities from 10 August 2021

Under Phase Two (Heightened Alert), from 22 July through 18 August 2021, tighter measures will apply to religious activities to reduce risks of community transmission. Following a mid-point review of Phase Two (Heightened Alert), we have updated the current safe management measures (SMMs) to prepare our transition towards COVID resilience. Please see ['Phase Two (Heightened Alert) Updated Measures for Religious Activities'](/media/PhaseTwo_EnhancedMeasures_ReligiousActivities_18Aug2021_final.pdf) document issued on 18 August 2021 for more detailed guidance.
