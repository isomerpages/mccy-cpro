      subtitle: We will continue to work closely with our communities to keep
        Singapore and our people safe. To protect everyoneâ€™s well-being, we urge
        our congregants to work with their religious leaders in implementing the
        precautionary measures advised by MOH and MCCY. By supporting each other
        in these challenging times and exercising social responsibility, we can
        overcome COVID-19, and emerge even stronger and more resilient. -
        Statement in support of staying united against COVID-19, National
        Steering Committee on Racial and Religious Harmony, 25 March 2020
