### Inter-faith Prayer by Religious Leaders to Boost Solidarity ### 

On 15 Feb 2020, we commemorated Total Defence Day to remind ourselves that, we, the people [of Singapore], must defend our country. As we continue our battle against Covid-19, Inter-Religious Organisation (IRO) leaders joined the front line of Singapore’s solidarity in collective prayer.

We thank our religious leaders for boosting the psychological resilience among our people.

It is also crucial for us to do our part to stop the spread of falsehoods on Covid-19 and defend our society digitally.

_Together we pray for and protect our Singapore._
