### IRCC, Team Nila and SFCCA Volunteers Appreciate Taxi Drivers at Changi Airport ### 

_“Taxi drivers work hard to keep our transport system running well and we want to do our part to say ‘Thank you’ for a job well done. It’s encouraging to see different religious and community organisations coming together with the same heart and purpose to love and cheer on our frontline heroes, and we will continue to stand united to support them.”_

Last Sunday, volunteers from Kampong Chai Chee IRCC, Serangoon IRCC, Heart of God Church, Yio Chu Kang Chapel , the Singapore Federation of Chinese Clan Associations and Team Nila distributed care packages and their heartfelt notes of encouragement and appreciation to taxi drivers at Changi Airport.

A big thank you to all our volunteers! Show our frontline heroes that we care today!
