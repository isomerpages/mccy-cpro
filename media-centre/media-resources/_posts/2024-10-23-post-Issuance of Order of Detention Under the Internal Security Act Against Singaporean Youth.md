<h4><strong><u>Issuance of Order of Detention against Self-Radicalised Singaporean Youth</u></strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A 17-year-old
male Singaporean was issued with an Order of Detention under the ISA in
Sep 2024. He was a staunch supporter of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria
(ISIS), and had planned to conduct a terrorist attack in Singapore.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The youth
was exposed to the teachings of foreign radical preachers in Aug 2023 while
searching for religious knowledge online. He started to <strong>subscribe to segregationist religious beliefs</strong>.
The youth was subsequently radicalised when he was exposed to pro-ISIS
materials online following HAMAS’s 7 Oct 2023 attacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By
Jan 2024, the youth had become a staunch ISIS supporter. In May 2024, he <strong>pledged his allegiance to ISIS</strong> and
was willing to carry out any instructions from the group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
youth wanted to travel to Syria to join ISIS and had researched on the
flight routes. However, due to the difficulties of getting there without
arousing suspicions from his family, he settled on <strong>conducting an attack on non-Muslim males in Singapore during the school holidays in Sep 2024</strong>.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The youth
made extensive plans and preparation for the attack. Inspired by ISIS’s
propaganda which glorified suicide knife attacks, he <strong>decided to conduct an attack near Tampines West Community Club </strong>as
it was crowded and was within walking distance from his home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The youth <strong>actively shared radical materials with the followers of his social media accounts</strong> as
he wanted to influence them into hating non-Muslims. Investigations showed
that the youth acted alone and was unsuccessful in radicalising his followers
or contacts. His family and friends were unaware of his plans to conduct
an attack in Singapore or engage in armed violence in Syria. However, his
parents had noticed that he was watching videos of foreign preachers and <strong>advised him against doing so</strong>.
The youth disregarded their advice and took steps to conceal his radical
activities online.</p>
<p><strong><u>Key Learning Points</u></strong>
</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The case
above shows that:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The spread of terrorist and extremist
ideologies online, especially those capitalising on the Israel-HAMAS conflict
to encourage violence, has fuelled the self-radicalisation threat in Singapore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
public, especially youths, should stay vigilant and be discerning in the
consumption of information on social media, to avoid falling prey to the
influence of divisive, extremist, or violent material online.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Youth radicalisation</strong>,
which usually takes place via online means, can occur within a span of
only a few months or even a much shorter timeframe.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time is of the essence when someone
displays signs of radicalisation. <strong>Early reporting can help save lives by ensuring that the individual receive timely help, guidance, and counselling.</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Family
members and friends are best placed to notice changes in behaviour and
alert the authorities if they suspect their loved ones have been radicalised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

the <a href="https://www.sgsecure.gov.sg/resources" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SGSecure website</a> to
download a resource kit on “Encouraging Early Reporting of Suspected Radicalised
Behaviours” which provides useful information on the signs of radicalisation,
the channels of reporting and the process after the information is submitted
to the authorities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Watch the interview with Dr Mohamed Bin Ali, an expert in inter-religious
relations and Co-Chairman and counsellor of the Religious Rehabilitation
Group (RRG), on the topic of radicalisation and rehabilitation of radicalised
persons on <em>The Daily Ketchup</em> podcast (link below).</p>
<p>Anyone who knows or suspects that a person is radicalised should <strong>promptly contact the ISD hotline 1800-2626-473</strong> (1800-2626-ISD)
or <strong>report via the SGSecure app</strong>.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The incident is a stark reminder
of the ever-present terrorism threat to Singapore and the importance of
staying prepared for a terror attack so that we are better able to bounce
back and emerge stronger as one united people. A whole-of-society approach
is crucial to safeguard our community.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have included the links
to the full press release on the case, Min/HA’s and MOS Sun’s Facebook
posts. We have also appended the link to the CNA documentary titled “<em>When Crisis Calls – Are We Truly Ready?”,</em> which
aired on 17 Oct and discussed the importance of preparedness in the face
of potential security threats and the roles that Singaporeans can play
in keeping our society resilient against terrorism.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also welcome your
feedback and observations of ground sentiments relating to the cases or
more broadly the threat of terrorism and other issues that could affect
our social cohesion. You can share your feedback and observations with
our Crisis Preparedness for Religious Organisations (CPRO) Office through
email (<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">cpro@mccy.gov.sg</a>).&nbsp;</p>
