<h3>About Crisis Preparedness for Religious Organisation (CPRO)</h3>
<p>The Crisis Preparedness for Religious Organisations (CPRO) programme aims
to strengthen crisis preparedness of Religious Organisations by building
capabilities to protect their premises and congregants, and help others
in the community in times of crises.</p>
<p>The CPRO is an initiative under MCCYâ€™s SGSecure Community Network (SGCN)
to ensure that all ROs are well-prepared for crises. MCCY partnered representatives
from Religious Organisations to develop the programme, and established
partnerships with security and community partners.</p>
<h3>Our Partners</h3>
<p>Our partners include the Singapore Police Force, Singapore Civil Defence
Force, Temasek Foundation and OnePeople.sg. Through these partnerships,
we have developed training programmes in emergency response skills, contingency
planning, psychological resilience support and mediation training.</p>
