### About Crisis Preparedness for Religious Organisation (CPRO)

The Crisis Preparedness for Religious Organisations (CPRO) programme aims to strengthen crisis preparedness of Religious Organisations by building capabilities to protect their premises and congregants, and help others in the community in times of crises.

The CPRO is an initiative under MCCYâ€™s SGSecure Community Network (SGCN) to ensure that all ROs are well-prepared for crises. MCCY partnered representatives from Religious Organisations to develop the programme, and established partnerships with security and community partners. 

### Our Partners

Our partners include the Singapore Police Force, Singapore Civil Defence Force, Temasek Foundation and OnePeople.sg. Through these partnerships, we have developed training programmes in emergency response skills, contingency planning, psychological resilience support and mediation training.
