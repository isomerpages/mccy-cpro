<b>Who we are</b>

The Crisis Preparedness for Religious Organisations (CPRO) programme is an initiative under MCCYâ€™s SGSecure Community Network (SGCN) to ensure that all ROs are well-prepared for crises. MCCY partnered representatives from Religious Organisations to develop the programme, and established partnerships with security and community partners.
